stories = ["""Once upon a time there lived a lion in a forest. One day after a heavy meal. It was sleeping under a tree. After a while, there came a mouse and it started to play on the lion. Suddenly the lion got up with anger and looked for those who disturbed its nice sleep. Then it saw a small mouse standing trembling with fear. The lion jumped on it and started to kill it. 
            The mouse requested the lion to forgive it. The lion felt pity and left it. The mouse ran away.
            On another day, the lion was caught in a net by a hunter. The mouse came there and cut the net. Thus it escaped. There after, the mouse and the lion became friends. They lived happily in the forest afterwards.
            Moral : A friend in need is a friend indeed.""",
            """This is a short story about Hungry Wolf.
            Once, a wolf was very hungry. It looked for food here and there. But it couldn't get any. At last it found a loaf of bread and piece of meat in the hole of a tree.
            The hungry wolf squeezed into the hole. It ate all the food. It was a woodcutter's lunch. He was on his way back to the tree to have lunch. But he saw there was no food in the hole, instead, a wolf.
            On seeing the woodcutter, the wolf tried to get out of the hole. But it couldn't. Its tummy was swollen.
            The woodcutter caught the wolf and gave it nice beatings.
